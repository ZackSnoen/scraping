# FreeCodeCamp Code Organizer
I wanted a place to hold my solutions as I went through FreeCodeCamp Certificates. This is my Python script to create folders for each Certificate, and the sections in each. Furthermore, making a .txt file with the task of each course seperated, leaving room to quickly copy/paste your code from FreeCodeCamp into the relative space as you work through each section.
## Run
python fccScrape.py
## File Structure
This is the file structure it creates as a sibling to where you clone this scraping folder
```
|-- scraping
|   |-- fccScrape.py
`-- fcc
    |-- responsive-web-design
    |   |-- applied-accessibility
    |   |   |-- mySolutions.txt
    |   |-- applied-visual-design
    |   |   |-- mySolutions.txt
    |   |-- basic-css

    |   |-- es6
    |   |   |-- mySolutions.txt
    |   |-- etc..
```
## mySolutions.txt
Here is the structure of the text file it creates, obviously each will have corresponding courses commented  
Just copy/paste your code into the corresponding mySolutions.txt as you work through FCC!
